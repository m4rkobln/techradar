## Description
RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. 

This project is a rewrite of Reactive-Extensions/RxJS with better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.
